OraRdkitCart is an Oracle data cartridge/extensible index to allow
substructure and similarity searching using SQL queries on tables
which contain indexed chemical structures.

It uses a Java RMI server and [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org>) wrappers for chemical structure
handling.

This software was developed with funding from [Beacon Discovery](https://www.beacondiscovery.com) 
and [Glysade LLC](https://www.glysade.com).
